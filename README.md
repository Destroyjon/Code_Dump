# Code_Dump
Place to put random coding projects and scripts

I am constantly learning new ways to go about coding. From learning about Nodes, and Stacks to Physics, and Geometry to simple OOP fundamentals.
This is just a disorganized place to put in ideas or simply testing new things I've learned.

Here is my attempt to organize or describe what is here.


Old_Code_Stuff:

  Random_Code:
  
    Linear Data Structers
    An incomplete attempt at Conways Game of Life using Linear Data Structers.
    
  World_Map:
  
    Using a simple method to create a grid based world map. (4-21)
    
    Trying to solve a problem from (CodeWars). /another place that I tried to get the core mechanics of Conways game of Life from Random_Code.
      Essentially make this do this.
      
      [0, 1, 1],            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0], -------->  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 1]             [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  
  The rest of the files are just for a simple physics engine but its old and outdated.
  
  
PixelGameJam:
  I joined a game jam in an attempt to get me to focus on a core project. I ended up focusing more on trying to figure out how to code to make things faster,
  and easier that I ran out of time leaving a very lack luster "Game". This has led me to wanting to learn and understand Game Engines at their core.
  
  
Test_Stuff:
  This is a combination of random ideas that I wanted to test and try for example. 
  
    Trying to make better sense of debugging, and writing better and more efficient code.
    
    Trying to see if I could write my own mathmatical equation to find the smallest number of any given numbers in an equation without using anything but math.
      It didn't go so well, but ended up making a really weird calculator to help find a possible solution.
